To complete this homework, you should do the following:
- Create a new issue on this repository. Include your AndrewID in the issue.
- Fork this repository.
- Clone the repository locally and add a new commit. The commit should add
  exactly one file (named andrewid.txt, but with your AndrewID). The file should
  contain the answer to the question "What is your favorite open-source
  project?"
- Once you've pushed your commit to your fork of my repo, make a pull request to
  my repo. In your pull request, you should reference the issue you created. Do
  this by including "Resolves #(issue number)" i.e. "Resolves" followed by a
  hashtag followed by the number of your issue, which you can find by going back
  to the issue you created.
- I'll accept your pull request if you did everything right, at which point the
  issue should be closed and you'll be done.
